# OpenGov Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
### The National Transparency Dashboard

![OpenGov Hero](/opengov-banner.png)

> **"Democracy requires a well-informed citizenry."**

**OpenGov** is a citizen-led initiative to demystify Sri Lanka's economic and political data. In an era of complexity, we build tools that make government spending, debt, and decision-making accessible to everyone—from policy researchers to the daily voter.

## Why We Built This
We believe that **data belongs to the people**. 

Too often, critical information about our nation's health is buried in PDF reports or complex spreadsheets. OpenGov transforms this raw data into **interactive, real-time visualizations** that tell a story. We aim to:
- **Simplify** complex economic figures (debt, tax, inflation).
- **Track** the progress of massive infrastructure projects.
- **Hold Accountable** the representatives we vote for.

## Key Features

A real-time "Bloomberg Terminal" for citizens.
- **Live Debt Clock**: Watch the national interest accumulate second-by-second.
- **Breaking News**: A scrolling ticker of the latest cabinet decisions.
- **Economic Vitals**: Instant view of Inflation, GDP, and Reserves.

### MP Watch (`/representatives`)
